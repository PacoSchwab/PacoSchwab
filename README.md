# Hallo Welt!

My name is Paco and I am an actor as well as a theatre- and psychotherapist, living in Berlin. I recently worked as a product manager and head coach for KidsCircle UG, a digital childcare service providing remote childcare sessions. In my free time I love hiking, dancing, theatre and sports.

My last travels led me to:

- scotland
- southeast asia
- norway
- poland
