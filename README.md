# Paco, frontend web developer

"After graduating from high school and starting a degree in education, I completed training as a state-certified actor. After gaining some experience on stage, I developed a connection to the social sector as a theater therapist and educator. Already during my work at KidsCircle, I had some exposure to coding and UX/UI, which is why I would like to specialize as a web developer in this field, as well as in accessibility, and bring in my social, communicative, creative, and organizational skills. I am also interested in a.i and it's usage to improve the UX. Building a bridge between the implementation of my creative ideas on the one hand and an visually appealing, user-friendly, and barrier-free user journey on the other is a matter of the heart to me."
